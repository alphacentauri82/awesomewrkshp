# Awesome Vue Workshop Content Manager

> Work In Progress

So.. since so far the firebase details are hardcoded.. In order to use it for your own content you will have to enter your own configs in `/src/main.js` ;)

## To do:

* Slides component
* Integrate codesandbox
* Gamification
* Admin Panel
---
## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
